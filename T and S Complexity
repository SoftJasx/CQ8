Time complexityï¼š
Outer Loop: There is an outer loop that iterates from 1 to n. Thus, it executes n times.
Inner Loops: Inside the outer loop, there are two inner loops:
The first inner loop is responsible for printing the spaces. In the worst case (first iteration), it prints n - 1 spaces, and in the best case (last iteration), it prints 0 spaces. On average, it prints spaces n/ 2 times for each row.
The second inner loop prints the # characters. It starts from 1 in the first iteration and goes up to n in the final iteration. Hence, it prints an average of n/2 hashes per row.
The total number of iterations for each inner loop per row is approximately n (summing the average number of spaces and hashes). 
Since each of these loops runs within the outer loop which itself runs n times, the number of total operations is roughly proportional to n*n = n^2.
Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2).

Space complexity:
Local Variables: The space taken up by local variables (i, j, k) is constant, irrespective of n.
Output: The staircase output itself, although large, is not typically considered part of space complexity unless it's stored entirely in memory at once before outputting. 
In this case, each line is output directly without storing the whole staircase, so it doesn't add to the space complexity.
No Additional Data Structures: The implementation does not use any data structures that scale with the size of the input.
Since the memory usage does not scale with n, the space complexity is O(1).
